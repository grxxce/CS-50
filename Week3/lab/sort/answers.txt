sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?:
I know this because Bubble sort should be the fastest on the pre-sorted list.
Sort 1 had 0m0.644s, which was the shortest time by far.




sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?:
It is the fastest when sorting the largest pile of randome numbers.
Sort 2 only used 0m0.588s when sorting 50000 random numbers



sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: 
Selection sort should not have a difference between best and worst case:

sorted50000: real    0m3.134s
